# Welcome to my profile!
I'm Renato, a cybersec nerd curious about Linux, Networks, Privacy and APTs. Sometimes I develop tools to protect systems or data, and share them here.
Feel free to check my projects and contribute!

## My Highlights
- [Enigmafy](https://github.com/cibero42/enigmafy): encrypt archives and folders to privately send them over the internet.
